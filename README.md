The flexibility to scale vertically anytime makes resource adjustments simple—add CPU cores, RAM, or storage instantly when growth demands it, then downgrade just as easily if needs decrease.

This extended trial period provides 50% more evaluation time, reducing risk when testing whether AltusHost meets your requirements. VPS plans include 14-day guarantees, another rarely-found feature demonstrating confidence in service quality. The easy upgrade and downgrade flexibility means you never pay for unused capacity.

Dedicated servers accommodate enterprise clients requiring maximum performance and control.

## FAQ

**What makes managed hosting worth the extra cost compared to unmanaged VPS or shared hosting?**

Managed hosting eliminates the technical expertise, time investment, and stress of handling server administration yourself. Expert teams monitor security 24/7, apply critical patches immediately rather than waiting for you to notice vulnerabilities, optimize performance continuously, and troubleshoot issues before they impact your site. For businesses where downtime costs hundreds per hour and hiring sys admins costs $80,000+ annually, managed hosting delivers professional infrastructure management at fraction of those costs while letting you focus on core business activities.

**How do European hosting providers like AltusHost differ from US-based alternatives?**

European hosts operate data centers within EU jurisdictions ensuring data stays compliant with GDPR and other European privacy regulations—critical for businesses handling EU customer information. Physical proximity to European audiences reduces latency improving site speeds for visitors in those regions. European providers often emphasize privacy and data sovereignty more than American hosts. However, European hosts may have fewer US data centers potentially affecting performance for primarily American audiences. Choose based on where your customers live and what regulations govern your data.

**What uptime percentage should you actually demand from managed hosting providers?**

Target 99.9% minimum uptime guarantees backed by service level agreements offering compensation when availability drops below promised levels. Premium hosts like Liquid Web and Hostwinds promise 99.999% (five nines) or even 99.9999% (six nines) meaning less than 6 minutes or 32 seconds of downtime annually respectively. For mission-critical applications where every second matters, pay premium for higher guarantees. For standard business sites, 99.9% (8.7 hours yearly downtime) provides adequate reliability at reasonable costs. Always verify guarantees include SLA compensation rather than meaningless promises with no recourse.
